// Julia and Kate are still studying dogs, and this time they are studying if dogs are
// eating too much or too little.
// Eating too much means the dog's current food portion is larger than the
// recommended portion, and eating too little is the opposite.
// Eating an okay amount means the dog's current food portion is within a range 10%
// above and 10% below the recommended portion (see hint).

const dogs = [
  { weight: 22, curFood: 250, owners: ["Alice", "Bob"] },

  { weight: 13, curFood: 275, owners: ["Sarah", "John"] },
  { weight: 32, curFood: 340, owners: ["Michael"] },
];

// Your tasks:
// 1. Loop over the 'dogs' array containing dog objects, and for each dog, calculate
// the recommended food portion and add it to the object as a new property.
// Do not create a new array, simply loop over the array.
//  Formula:
// recommendedFood = weight ** 0.75 * 28. (The result is in grams of food, and the weight needs to be in kg)

dogs.forEach((dog) => {
  dog.recommendedFood = Math.trunc(dog.weight ** 0.75 * 28);
});

// 2. Find Sarah's dog and log to the console whether it's eating too much or too
// little. Hint: Some dogs have multiple owners, so you first need to find Sarah in
// the owners array, and so this one is a bit tricky (on purpose) ðŸ¤“

console.log(ownersEatTooMuch.join(" and ") + "'s dogs eat too much");

// 5. Log to the console whether there is any dog eating exactly the amount of food that is recommended (just true or false)
console.log(dogs.some((dog) => dog.curFood == dog.recommendedFood));

// 6. Log to the console whether there is any dog eating an okay amount of food (just true or false)
console.log(dogs.some((dog) => dog.curFood > dog.recommendedFood * 0.9 && dog.curFood < dog.recommendedFood * 1.1));
